# Common Password Checker

## Project Creation

This project was developed using a [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The code was committed to [Git](https://git-scm.com) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com) using the terminal.

The project was started by navigating to [GitHub](https://github.com) and creating a new repository by clicking `New` button. Under 'Repository name' I input 'common_password_checker' and then clicked 'Create repository'.

I opened VS Code and initialized directory 'common_password_checker': 
```
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/BogdanCatalin-Iacob/common_password_checker.git
git push -u origin main
```

The following commands were used throughout the project:
* `git add` - This command was used to add files to the staging area before commiting.
* `git commit` -m *commit message explaining teh updates* - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository.
* `git push` - This command was used to push all commited changes to the GitHub repository.
